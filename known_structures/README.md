## Notes from Dave:


archiveII is what you should be using now.  It is the same families we have had in archive, but updated with the latest databases.  Mike Sloma, a graduate student, did the work.
I am pretty sure that all the filenames now start with the RNA family name and end with the database accession #.  
 
The latest reference that details the families is:

Bellaousov, S., & Mathews, D. H. (2010). ProbKnot: fast prediction of RNA secondary structure including pseudoknots. RNA. 16, 1870-1880.
 Another database you should also fetch from cvs is: RNA_stralign.  That database has structures and alignments for eight families, and a ReadMe that provides a lot of detail.
